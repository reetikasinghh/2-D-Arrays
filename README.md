# 2-D-Arrays
Matrix Operations in C++
Aim
The aim of this C++ program is to perform various operations on a matrix, including comparing rows and columns, calculating row sums, column sums, and more.

Theory
This program focuses on working with two-dimensional arrays (matrices) in C++ and offers a variety of matrix operations. It provides options to:

Compare Rows: It can compare the elements of any two rows within the matrix to determine if they are equal.

Row Sum: Calculate the sum of elements in a specified row.

Column Sum: Calculate the sum of elements in a specified column.

Transpose: Find the transpose of the given matrix.

Product: Compute the product of two matrices if they are compatible.

Scalar Multiplication: Multiply the matrix by a scalar value.

Display Matrix: View the matrix after performing the chosen operation.

Algorithm
Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns for the matrix.
Capture the dimensions provided by the user.
Declare a two-dimensional integer array to represent the matrix.
Input the elements of the matrix by looping through each row and column.
Provide a menu for the user to choose the matrix operation they want to perform.
Based on the user's choice, implement the corresponding algorithm to perform the operation.
Display the resulting matrix or appropriate output based on the operation performed.
Conclusion
This program is a versatile tool for performing a wide range of matrix operations. It not only enables you to compare rows and columns but also offers functionalities such as calculating sums, finding the transpose, performing matrix multiplication, and more. Understanding these matrix operations is valuable in various fields, including mathematics, data analysis, and computer graphics. By allowing users to choose the operation they want to perform, the program becomes a valuable educational and problem-solving tool.
